Urdu meanings are given for the difficult words so that you don't need open a dictionary to look for a word.

                                        Topic sentence:This is the first sentence of a paragraph, and it serves as an introduction to the topic or main idea of the paragraph. It is typically the first sentence of a paragraph and may serve as a transition from the ideas in the preceding paragraph.

                                        Supporting details:These are sentences that explain or develop the main idea in more detail and provide specific examples or evidence to support it. They can either be facts, opinions, statistics and anecdotes among others.

                                        Transition word/phrase: This is a word or phrase that shows logical relationship between ideas within a sentence, between sentences, or between paragraphs and it helps to achieve coherence in writing by showing how one idea relates to another. Examples are; however, hence ,in addition,in fact ,on the contrary etc

                                        Concluding statement closes a paragraph and it restates the main idea of your paragraph. In this kind of writing, you need to convince your reader that your opinion is right by giving solid reasons for your opinion and supporting them with strong examples and evidence.

                                        The term "paragraph" refers to a group of sentences that are related to a single subject and are organized and coherent. Paragraphs should be used for almost every piece of writing longer than a few sentences. </p>
